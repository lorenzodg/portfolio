                    Hello viewers! Welcome to my page, I am Lorenzo De Guzman and
                    I aspire currently toward somewhere in the Engineering Field
                    as a lot of family and friends push give me confidence into
                    the category. I see lots of opportunity today and in the future
                    regarding to the field of Engineering. There is a bountiful 
                    amount of companies in need of Engineering related associates,
                    which is a big reason why I would like to pursue this type of
                    career. I will achieve this goal by giving school my best,
                    and to go for the best possible college in my reach. </p>
                <p>I consider myself as flexible team member since I can become
                     efficient in areas where I would be arbitrarily placed. I also
                     tie this on to being a Team Player as I would add some necessary
                     to some ideas or pieces of work. This shines when group projects
                     come into play or simply assisting one of my peers in completing
                     mine or their work. And of course, I may have a downfall 
                     here in there in a project, but that is why I strive to only
                     succeed and progress in my working habits.</p>
                <p> I have learned many things from my past hindrances and capabilities
                about how I work. I tend to overthink how parts of the work will
                turn out to be or how effective it may be. This makes my work 
                time become cramped as the a good amount of my time willd be picking
                at imperfections that fine. But, this comes in handy when I actually
                fix the problems I wouldn't normally see.</p>
