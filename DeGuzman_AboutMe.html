            Lorenzo De Guzman and I aspire currently toward somewhere in the 
            Engineering Field as a lot of family
        and friends push give me confidence into the category. I see lots of 
        oppurtunity today and in the future regarding to the field of 
        Engineering. There is a boutiful amount of companies in need of 
        Engineering related associates, which is a big reason why I would like
        to pursure this type of career. I consider myself as flexible team member
        since I can become efficient in areas where I would be arbitrarily placed.
        I also tie this on to being a Team Player as I would add some backbone 
        to some ideas or piecesof work. This shines when group projects come into play or simply
        assisting one of my peers in completing mine or their work. Speaking of
        accomplishing tasks, I have some achievements this Freshman year. </p>
