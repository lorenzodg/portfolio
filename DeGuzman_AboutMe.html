                    Hello viewers and welcome to my page! My name is Lorenzo De 
                    Guzman and I aspire to work somewhere in the engineering field. 
                    A lot of family and friends give me the confidence and motivation 
                    to fulfill my ambition. I see lots of opportunities regarding 
                    the field of engineering. There is a substantial amount of 
                    companies in need of engineering related associates, which 
                    is a big reason why I would like to pursue this type of career.
                    I will achieve this goal by giving school my best, and to 
                    go for the best possible college in my reach.</p>
                <p> I consider myself as a flexible team member since I can become
                efficient in areas where I would be arbitrarily placed. I also 
                tie this on to being a team player, as I would aid in formulating
                ideas or pieces of work. This shines when I work in group projects,
                or assist peers in completing work. Of course I may have setbacks
                in a project, but that is why I strive to succeed and progress in
                my working habits.</p>
                <p> I have learned many things from my past hindrances and capabilities 
                about how I work. I tend to overthink how the work will turn out
                or how effective it may be. This makes my work time become cramped,
                for a large amount of my time will be spent picking at miniscule
                imperfections. However, this comes in handy when I fix the problems
                I would not normally see.</p>
