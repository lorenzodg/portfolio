                    <p class="card-text"> Our task was to create a game or story in Scratch.
                    We imediatly agreed on creating a story. Our tale was based 
                    on a human-like entity in another realm, attempting to find 
                    treasure inside of a old temple. The task inside the game was
                    to choose options in order to find the lost treasure, awaiting
                    inside the temple. In this project, we had a very trusted
                    type partnership so there was no need for any type of role. 
                    We could bounce ideas back and forth to each other, discuss
                    it, and then place the altercation into the story. We both 
                    displayed our strengths in creativity, effiency, and 
                    collaboration better tahn I thought we would.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Megan and I had the task of choosing a
                    game to recreate, and have give the game our own touch to it.
                    We chose the option of the State Quiz, since the superior 
                    alternatives were already occupied by fellow peers. After we
                    executed the task of replicating the standard version Quiz, 
                    we gave it our spin of adding a whole other extra quiz inside 
                    of the regular Quiz. We also completed the extra touches of 
                    making navigation more straightforward, appealing design, and
                    any corrections to the recent changes that we implemented. 
                    At this point, both is had increased the skills of solving 
                    problems. </p>
