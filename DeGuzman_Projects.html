                    <p class="card-text">Our task was to create a game or story in Scratch.
                    We immediately agreed on creating a story. Our tale was based 
                    on a human-like entity in another realm, attempting to find 
                    treasure inside of a old temple. The task inside the game was
                    to choose options in order to find the lost treasure, awaiting
                    inside the temple. In this project, we had a very trusted
                    type partnership so there was no need for any type of role. 
                    We could bounce ideas back and forth to each other, discuss
                    it, and then place the altercation into the story. We both 
                    displayed our strengths in creativity, efficiency, and 
                    collaboration better than I thought we would. In the end, we 
                    the only group to go down the path of creating a story. A lot 
                    of people had interest in our project, but there were faults.
                    We had expected them but we knew we could fix the errors. 
                    Either way we had been satisfied with our work, and now we 
                    strive for exponential growth for future projects and work. </p>

                    Project | Febuary 2019 | Ethan Fernando | Lorenzo De Guzman | CSP</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Our task provided was to manipulate an 
                    image fitting to the chosen scenario. First we had gotten 
                    into pairs, and after that we had done a couple activities 
                    about images and how to alter them. After we got used to 
                    each other and the concept, we had to choose our scenario. 
                    We had choices of making a family picture frame, advertise 
                    a political cause, or promote a new tool similar to 
                    Photoshop. We had chosen the last option, which was to 
                    promote a product that is prevalent in today's society. We 
                    brainstormed for a long time as there many things that our 
                    society needs. From new pans, to household items. We noticed
                    the trend on gaming, so we decided on a gaming chair ready 
                    for anyone. Going down this path, we both realized each 
                    other's strengths and downs. We knew that we had lots of 
                    time, but also a lot of work. We continued to work but we 
                    didn't focus on the correct parts so we fell behind. We did 
                    make our parts up over the weekend and we finished the 
                    project. We had many errors in just planning itself, and 
                    more in coding and ways of coding. We finally learned that 
                    our skills and lessons were learned there, and the price 
                    was paid with the final verdict of grading. But, this is 
                    what motivates us and pushes us as scholars.</p>
